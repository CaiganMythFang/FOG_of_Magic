Or you can earn money, and buy them from me directly. \n    You can then spend these Forbidden Knowledge Coins to have us Unlock Lost Knowledge for you.

It\u0027s very expensive, as the reagents for the rituals are nothing to sneeze at.\n    But what you get is the ability to make everything from a section of Lost Knowledge yourself.
